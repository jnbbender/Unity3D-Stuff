To use this invisibility cloak, simply attach the CloakEffect.cs script to your SkinnedMeshRenderer or MeshRenderer.  NOTE: The script uses a Button defined as "Cloak" in the Input Manager but you can use whatever you want.  Replace it with a KeyCode or just call the functions directly some other way.

The AudioSource and sound effects are optional but I've included them with the package.  The sound effects were from an older tutorial by SpeedTutor (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFaPjw5zdZg) but I can't seem to find his audio files :O

Finally, attach the Invisibility Material to the script and you're good to go.
The Shader & Material were developed using **Amplify Shader Editor** (https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/visual-scripting/amplify-shader-editor-68570) and following the instructional videos:
