This folder contains a collection of Utility scripts collected over the years to help with common in-game functions or Inspector enhancements.

* `BorderWarning.cs` is a script which is intended to be attached to a collider which defines your environment boundaries. Marked as a trigger, when the Player enters the boundary the PostProcessingLayer will turn Grey & a countdown 'till death will be displayed.
* `ConsoleGUI.cs` is simply a script which will direct all the Console logs to the screen.
